            There is no use of learning a technology if that can not be put in to use for building something out of it.
            The Technol way of learning allows the students to actually do the work hands on through Internship
             opportunities. The Technol internships are not like regular internships. Our Interns work on
            Company projects and in the process Learn and Build all at the same time. So do not wait up kick off
            your career with an Internship with us.
